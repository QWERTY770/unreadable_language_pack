# Minecraft Unreadable Language Resource Pack

- **[English](/README_en.md) | [中文](/README.md)**

----

This project provides a resource package that converts the source strings of Minecraft: Java Edition language files into Katakana and converts Simplified Chinese into Chinese Pinyin and IPA.

It is recommended to use this resource pack with the mods [Language Reload](https://modrinth.com/mod/language-reload) and [Untranslated Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/untranslated-items).

## Description

## Dependencies

Install dependencies using the following command:

``` shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Obtaining Language Files

This repository automatically checks for updates to Minecraft: Java Edition language file (`en_us.json`, `zh_cn.json`, `ja_jp.json`) every day at 🕧00:30 (UTC+8, equivalent to 🕟UTC 16:30) and updates the resource pack accordingly. This is done using the script [`source.py`](/source.py) (requires `requests`, `romajitable`, `pypinyin` and `pypinyin_dict`). The obtained language files are stored in the `source` folder, which is at the same level as the script.

### Resource Pack

The resource pack is generated using [`pack.py`](/pack.py). The language files generated by the script are [`ja_kk.json`](/ja_kk.json), [`zh_py.json`](/zh_py.json) and [`zh_ipa.json`](/zh_ipa.json), which are packed together with [`pack.mcmeta`](/pack.mcmeta) into `unreadable_language_pack.zip`.

The resource pack added 3 languages into the game:

- "エングリスホ (カタカナ)" (i.e. "English (Katakana)"). Once selected, all strings will be changed to Katakana transliterated from English.
- “pīn yīn (zhōng guó)”（i.e. “拼音 (中国)”）。Once selected, all strings will be changed to Chinese Pinyin transliterated from Simp. Chinese.
- “pʰin˥ jin˥ (t͡ʂʊŋ˥ kwo˧˥)”（i.e. “拼音 (中国)”）。Once selected, all strings will be changed to IPA transliterated from Simp. Chinese.
