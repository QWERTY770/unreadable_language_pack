This project provides a Minecraft: Java Edition resource pack which contains new non-standard "languages" converted from existing languages. See the section [#Resource Pack](#resource-pack) for more information.

Please use the mod [Modern UI](https://modrinth.com/mod/modern-ui) to make the game support modern font features to ensure that all characters are displayed normally.

It is recommended to use this resource pack with the mods [Language Reload](https://modrinth.com/mod/language-reload) and [Untranslated Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/untranslated-items).

## Description

## Dependencies

Install dependencies using the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Obtaining Language Files

This repository automatically checks for updates to Minecraft: Java Edition language file (`en_us.json`, `zh_cn.json`) every day at 🕧00:30 (UTC+8, equivalent to 🕟UTC 16:30) and updates the resource pack accordingly.

### Resource Pack

The resource pack is generated using [`pack.py`](pack.py). The language files generated by the script are stored in the `output` folder, which are packed together with [`pack.mcmeta`](pack.mcmeta) and [`pack.png`](pack.png) into `unreadable_language_pack.zip`.

The resource pack added 15 languages into the game.

> [!TIP]
> The Chinese transcription comparison table used in this project is shown in the following two tables:
>
> [`comparison_table_1.tsv`](table/comparison_table_1.tsv) (with tones, phonetic notation scheme)
>
> [`comparison_table_2.tsv`](table/comparison_table_2.tsv) (without tones, foreign language transcription)
>
> The table may contain syllables that do not exist in Putonghua, such as lüan, etc., for reference only.
>
> The table omits the transliterations of ㆭ (ng, /ŋ̍/), ㆬ (m, /m̩/), ㄯ (n, /n̩/), ㄏㆬ (hm, /xm̩/), and ㄏㆭ (hng, /xŋ̍/). Most schemes do not specify how they should be spelled, and these syllables are not actually used in this project.

#### "i18nglish (i7h)" ([`en_i7h.json`](output/en_i7h.json))

- Once selected, all strings will be changed to abbreviations with the first and last characters of the English word retained and the number of characters in the middle replaced. Words with a length of 2 or less will remain unchanged.

#### "エングリスホ (カタカナ)" ([`ja_kk.json`](output/ja_kk.json))

- i.e. "English (Katakana)".
- Once selected, all strings will be changed to Katakana transliterated from English.

> [!WARNING]
> English transliteration to katakana uses the mapping of [KotRikD/romajitable](https://github.com/KotRikD/romajitable). This is not a correct translation method and **may be very different from the real pronunciation in English**. **Please do not use the transliteration results outside of entertainment scenarios.**
>
> Transliterations of "Lena Raine" and "Samuel Åberg" will be fixed and "C418" will be retained in the results.

#### "江尓具利須保 (万葉仮名)" ([`ja_my.json`](output/ja_my.json))

- i.e. "English (Man'yōgana)".
- Once selected, all character strings will be converted into Man'yōganas transliterated from English. In order to ensure that the generated results do not deviate too much, only one of the many possibilities of Man'yōganas is selected.

#### "Hànyǔ Pīnyīn (Zhōngguó Dàlù)" ([`zh_py.json`](output/zh_py.json))

- i.e. "Pinyin (Chinese mainland)".
- Once selected, all strings will be changed to Pinyin transliterated from Simp. Chinese, in units of words.
  - Tried to follow the orthographic requirements of GB/T 16159-2012.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The transliteration of Chinese uses the libraries `pypinyin` and `pypinyin_dict`, supplements the data of [cc_cedict.org](https://cc-cedict.org/), and manually adds the pronunciation of some words. In principle, the pronunciation is based on the Putonghua phonetic system. Other phonetic transcription schemes are based on this data.
>
> The word segmentation of Chinese uses the library `jieba`, with configurations of the dictionaries and corrections.
>
> Although processed, the results are still not guaranteed to fully comply with the requirements of GB/T 16159-2012. Where dashes should be added, there is no suitable method to meet the requirements.
>
> Tone sandhi (such as "一" and "不") won't be marked according to the requirements of GB/T 16159-2012.
>
> **Due to the lack of complete manual review, the word segmentation accuracy of long texts cannot be guaranteed.**
