# Minecraft Translation Key Language Resource Pack

- **[English](/README_en.md) | [ä¸­æ–‡](/README.md)**

----

This project provides a resource pack that transcribes the source strings of Minecraft: Java Edition language files into katakana.

It is recommended to use this resource pack with the mods [Language Reload](https://modrinth.com/mod/language-reload) and [Untranslated Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/untranslated-items).

## Description

### Obtaining Language Files

This repository automatically checks for updates to Minecraft: Java Edition language file (`en_us.json`) every day at ðŸ•§00:30 (UTC+8, equivalent to ðŸ•ŸUTC 16:30) and updates the resource pack accordingly. This is done using the script [`source.py`](/source.py) (requires `requests` and `romajitable`). The obtained language files are stored in the `source` folder, which is at the same level as the script.

### Resource Pack

The resource pack is generated using [`pack.py`](/pack.py). The language files generated by the script are [`ja_kk.json`](/ja_kk.json), which are packed together with [`pack.mcmeta`](/pack.mcmeta) into `katakana_language_pack.zip`.

The resource pack adds a language called "ã‚¨ãƒ³ã‚°ãƒªã‚¹ãƒ› (ã‚«ã‚¿ã‚«ãƒŠ)" (i.e. "English (Katakana)") to the game. Once selected, all strings will be changed to Katakana transliterated in English.
